Automation project task:
I work as a video ad analyst at the Sterling & Draper advertising agency. I devote a lot of time to analyzing trending videos on YouTube to determine what content deserves marketing attention.
Each video has a specific category (Entertainment, Music, News & Politics, etc.), region, and trending date.
A video can be in the trending section for several days in a row.
Every week, the new employees Melanie and Ashok ask you the same questions:
What video categories were trending last week?
How were they distributed among various regions?
What categories were especially popular in the United States?
In my sixth week on the job, I decide that it's high time the process were automated. I am going to make a dashboard for Melanie and Ashok.
