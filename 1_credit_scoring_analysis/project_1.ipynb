These missing values came to our data because of specifics of writing this data down: it has processed no income as an empty data, and it wasn't useful for us.\n",

    "There is a lot of different data, that could have been combined in from 4 to 6 groups. After haveing a thorough look at it I have found out that there are some values that aren't specific enough. This values are: housing transactions, housing, property, real estate transactions, building a property, building a real estate, buy real estate, etc. It would have been good to have different groups for buying commertial real estate, buying private real estate, building commercial real estate, building private real estate. In real life we could have requested more information, maybe something that would have helped us to specify which goes where. But unfortunatly I didn't have this option here, therefore I have decided to put all of these purposes in a single group, called <b>real estate</b>.\n",
